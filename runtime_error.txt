    for k, v in a.iteritems():
AttributeError: 'EasyDict' object has no attribute 'iteritems'

==> Python 3 renamed dict.iteritems -> dict.items

  File "/content/StackGAN-v2-rev/code/miscc/config.py", line 76, in _merge_a_into_b
    if not b.has_key(k):
AttributeError: 'EasyDict' object has no attribute 'has_key'

==> has_key was removed in Python 3. From the documentation:
Removed dict.has_key() â€“ use the in operator instead.

  File "/content/StackGAN-v2-rev/code/datasets.py", line 230, in load_bbox
    for i in xrange(0, numImgs):
NameError: name 'xrange' is not defined

==> You are trying to run a Python 2 codebase with Python 3. xrange() was renamed to range() in Python 3.

    embeddings = pickle.load(f)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xbe in position 3: ordinal not in range(128)

==> Instead of relying on a system setting, you should open your text files using an explicit codec:
currentFile = open(filename, 'rt', encoding='latin1')
where you set the encoding parameter to match the file you are reading.

  File "/content/StackGAN-v2-rev/code/datasets.py", line 244, in load_captions
    captions = f.read().decode('utf8').split('\n')
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'

==> You are trying to decode an object that is already decoded. You have a str, there is no need to decode from UTF-8 anymore.
Simply drop the .decode('utf-8') part:

  File "/content/StackGAN-v2-rev/code/trainer.py", line 20, in <module>
    from tensorboard import FileWriter
ImportError: cannot import name 'FileWriter'

==> Use tensorboard-pytorch (pip install tensorboard-pytorch). Do this:
from torch.utils.tensorboard import summary
from torch.utils.tensorboard import FileWriter
instead of:
from tensorboard import summary
from tensorboard import FileWriter

TypeError: Couldn't build proto file into descriptor pool!
Invalid proto descriptor for file "tensorboard/compat/proto/tensor_shape.proto":

==> Right, this is an issue with protobuf binary wheels. The work around it to install the pure python implementation or fix proto files, so they don't have namespace collisions.
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install --no-binary=protobuf protobuf

File "/content/StackGAN-v2-rev/code/trainer.py", line 613, in train_Dnet
    summary_D = summary.scalar('D_loss%d' % idx, errD.data[0])
IndexError: invalid index of a 0-dim tensor. Use `tensor.item()` in Python or `tensor.item<T>()` in C++ to convert a 0-dim tensor to a number

==> That's because in PyTorch>=0.5, the index of 0-dim tensor is invalid. The master branch is designed for PyTorch 0.4.1, loss_val.data[0] works well.
