# StackGAN-v2 revision for Colab

This is StackGAN_v2 revised version for Google Colab.

Refer to [https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN-v2](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN-v2) for original source version, <br>
it is implementation for the paper [StackGAN++: Realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10916).

Refer to troubleshooting [issues](https://github.com/rightlit/StackGAN-v2-rev/issues) while running with original source 



### Dependencies
python 3.6

Pytorch 1.7.0+cu101

In addition, please add the project folder to PYTHONPATH and `pip install` the following packages:
- `tensorboardX == 1.1` 


**Data**

1. Download our preprocessed char-CNN-RNN text embeddings for [birds](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3y_msrWZaXLT1BZdVdycDY5TEE) and [flowers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3y_msrWZaXLaUc0UXpmcnhaVmM) and save them to `Data/`
  - [Optional] Follow the instructions [reedscot/icml2016](https://github.com/reedscot/icml2016) to download the pretrained char-CNN-RNN text encoders and extract text embeddings.
2. Download the [birds](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) and [flowers](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/) image data. Extract them to `Data/birds/` and `Data/flowers/`, respectively.


**Evaluating**
- Run `python main.py --cfg cfg/eval_birds.yml --gpu 1` to generate samples from captions in birds validation set.
- Run `python main.py --cfg cfg/eval_flowers.yml --gpu 1` to generate samples from captions in flowers validation set.
- Change the `eval_*.yml` files to generate images from other pre-trained models.
