### Dependencies
python 3.6

Pytorch

In addition, please add the project folder to PYTHONPATH and `pip install` the following packages:
- `tensorboardX` or `pytorch-tensorbord`


**Data**

1. Download our preprocessed char-CNN-RNN text embeddings for [birds](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3y_msrWZaXLT1BZdVdycDY5TEE) and save them to `data/`
  - [Optional] Follow the instructions [reedscot/icml2016](https://github.com/reedscot/icml2016) to download the pretrained char-CNN-RNN text encoders and extract text embeddings.
2. Download the [birds](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) image data. Extract them to `data/birds/`


**Training**

- Train a StackGAN-v2 model on the bird (CUB) dataset using our preprocessed embeddings:
  -  `python main.py --cfg cfg/birds_3stages.yml --gpu 0`

- If you want to try your own datasets, [here](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) are some good tips about how to train GAN. Also, we encourage to try different hyper-parameters and architectures, especially for more complex datasets.



**Pretrained Model**
- [StackGAN-v2 for bird](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s5Yf3nFiXx0lltMFOiJWB6s1LP24RcwH). Download and save it to `models/` (The [inception score](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN-inception-model) for this Model is 4.04Â±0.05)



**Evaluating**
- Run `python main.py --cfg cfg/eval_birds.yml --gpu 1` to generate samples from captions in birds validation set.
- Change the `eval_*.yml` files to generate images from other pre-trained models.
